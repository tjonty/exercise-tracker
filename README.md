## Exercise Tracker
Exercise Tracker allows users to keep track of their everyday activities.

## Demo ⚙️
[visit the live app](https://dazzling-bell-a1d1b9.netlify.app)

## Motivation 💪
To learn both Node.js and React, you'll need to integrate them as practice.As a result, I decided to create an exercise tracker that will assist users, as well as myself, in keeping track of their exercise records.
